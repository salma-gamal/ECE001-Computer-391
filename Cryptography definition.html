<p>These days, every human activity is deeply associated with computing systems. This computing technology is implemented in every application in the domain of healthcare, education, banking, software, and marketing. But you might get wondered how organizations secure their information and how your banking transactions are kept confidential. The answer to all of these is “Cryptography”. Almost 90% of the internet websites implement either type of cryptography service to handle their sensitive data. Also, cryptography secures Gmail information in an encrypted format as this data float all across the Google data centers. So, cryptography stands as the fundamental feature to safeguard the shared information.</p>
<h3>What is Cryptography?</h3>
<p>ryptography is a method of protecting information and communicationsthrough the use of codes, so that only those for whom the information isintended can read and process it. The prefix "crypt-" means "hidden" or"vault" -- and the suffix "-graphy" stands for "writing."In computer science, cryptography refers to secure information andcommunication techniques derived from mathematical concepts and a set of rule-based calculations called algorithms, to transform messages in ways that are hard to decipher. These deterministic algorithms are used for cryptographic key generation, digital signing, verification to protectdata privacy, web browsing on the internet, and confidential communicationssuch as credit card transactions and email.
