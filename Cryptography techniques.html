Cryptography is closely related to the disciplines of cryptology and cryptanalysis. It includes techniques such as microdots, merging words with images, and other ways to hide information in storage or transit. However, in today's computer-centric world, cryptography is most often associated with scrambling plaintext (ordinary text, sometimes referred to as clear text) into cipher text (a process called encryption), then back again (known as decryption). Individuals who practice this field are known as cryptographers.
<h3>Modern cryptography concerns with:</h3>
<ul id="p04">
<li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Information cannot be understood by anyone</li>
<li><strong>Integrity:</strong> Information cannot be altered</li>
<li><strong>Non-repudiation:</strong> Sender cannot deny his/her intentions in the transmission of the information at a later stage</li>
<li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Sender and receiver can confirm each</li>

</ul>

</p>
<p>Procedures and protocols that meet some or all of the above criteria are known as cryptosystems. Cryptosystems are often thought to refer only to mathematical procedures and computer programs; however, they also include the regulation of human behavior, such as choosing hard-to-guess passwords, logging off unused systems, and not discussing sensitive procedures with outsiders.
